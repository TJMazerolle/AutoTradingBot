# AutoTradingBot

NOTE: The xpaths of the current implementation are out of date, so this script will not work until they are updated.

This script is set up so that using Selenium with a FireFox web driver, the script can log in to a Questrade account and execute trades based on a set of trade signals that are determined.  In the future, the intention is to have a seperate prediction script set up to predict the movements of currency pairs and have this script execute the trades automatically.  However for now, we are just scrapping the signals from https://ca.investing.com/currencies/streaming-forex-rates-majors.
